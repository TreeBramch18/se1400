                Cran is not a just another video game it is another world and you get to explore it and what not. While
                some people may be out hunting dragons others could be building a baked goods enterprise to pass on to
                their evil child, thank goodness they have that magic cricket for them. For those who perfer a more
                structured gameplay try out our <a href="boardgame.html">Board Game</a>.

                The world of cran is expnasive and created by us humans. The map is not generated by ai and our work
                isn't copy paste from some trash. A nerdy world created by nerds, filled with secrets to find and
                interactions waiting for you. This expansive world is open for complete exploration, never will there be
                an area that can't be explored.
