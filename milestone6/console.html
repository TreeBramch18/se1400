                This is our console, the Cran sphere! The greatest piece of technology the gaming industry has ever
                seen. Using our console you'll be able to access our master piece, <a href="game.html">Cran</a>, the video
                game. With this console you will never suffer any sort of performance issue while playing Cran. The sole
                purpose of this device is to play our game so users will have access to all the best settings and
                quality of life innovations we bring.

                don't know much about the stuff and don't really care just know that you won't have to play with any
                settings trying to find good performance as everything will be put on the highest quality.

                Our controllers are super cool, buy them. Seriously. Designed with comfort in mind, each controller features a
                smooth ergonomic grip that feels like it was molded by ancient artisans who somehow predicted the shape of your
                hands. Every button has the perfect “click,” tested by our team of totally real scientists who pressed each one
                thousands of times while arguing about lore. Wireless, durable, and capable of surviving at least three rage-throws
                (not tested with kyle), this controller gives you the precision and reliability you need to dominate every corner of Cran's
                world. If the Sphere is the heart of the system, then this is the sword you wield to conquer it.
