                Check out our console, the <a href="console.html">Cran Sphere</a> — the centerpiece of everything we've built. 
                This strange glowing orb is more than just hardware, it's the gateway to the massive fantasy world we've been 
                imagining, sketching, and arguing about since childhood. The Sphere is engineered for one purpose and one purpose 
                only: to run our game at absolute peak performance. No stutters, no lag, no mysterious “update required” screens — 
                just pure, uninterrupted gameplay. Dive into sprawling cities, cursed forests, and questionable NPC life choices 
                without ever worrying that your console is about to melt into a puddle. With the Cran Sphere, the only limit is how 
                long your eyes can stay open and how long you can put your homework off.
