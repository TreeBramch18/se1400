            <h2>Website Summary:</h2>
            <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
            <p>
                This site will contain all the products of Cran, how to get the products as well as tons of info on our
                products to help potential buyers make their choice and buy some goods
            </p>
            <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
            <p>
                The images will be pulled from the internet, created with AI, or possible even drawn/designed by one of
                the employees of Cran. We shall write the text ourselves or pull it from our other websites of ours that
                have specific products.
            </p>
            <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
            <p>
                They will care for the site as it will be the main hub to all our different products. This site will
                direct people all around to the places they wanna go while also advertising the other products as the
                user makes their way across the Website
            </p>
            <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
            <p>
                Because Cran will have a plethera of different products to sell and it would be difficult to always try
                to advertise everything on seperate websites so instead we build this main hub to advertise and directs
                users so that we only have to do the advertising in one spot without having to rely on word of mouth or
                some random ad to catch their attention
            </p>
            <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
            <p>
                Visit the different websites that we will guide them to and buy our products
            </p>
            <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
            <p>
                To advertise and direct users to the many products of Cran without them having to go through the hassle
                of finding a bunch of different websites. This site will be the hub for all customers of Cran so we can
                expose them to all of our different goods and get them intersted
            </p>
